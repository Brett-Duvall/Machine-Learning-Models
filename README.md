10 Fold Cross Validation

Profiling Data. Baseline model with 10-Fold Cross-Validation. Logistic Regression model with 10-Fold Cross-Validation. Naive Bayes model with 10-Fold Cross-Validation. Decision Tree model with 10-Fold Cross-Validation. SVM model with 10-Fold Cross-Validation. Random Forrest model with 10-Fold Cross-Validation. Plot ROC Curve Random Forrest. Random Forrest model with 10-Fold Cross-Validation.


logistic_regression_model

Build a logistic regression model Using the dataset “student_data.csv,” write code to (1) create a visualization of the data, (2) fit a model using logistic regression, (3) output model coefficients and performance metrics such as accuracy and AUC and ROC; NOTE: For this exercise, you will train and test on the same given dataset, instead of doing train/test split.


SVM using Linear kernel and RBF Kernel

Write code to fit a Support Vector Machine model using (1) linear kernel and (2) RBF kernel. For the RBF kernel, use grid search to find the best gamma parameter using k-fold cross-validation.
